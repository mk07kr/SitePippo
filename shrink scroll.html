      There’s a magic in the way you look at me, a quiet reassurance that no matter what, I’m home when I’m with you. I take endless pictures of you because each one is a window into the love we’ve built, a love that grows stronger every time I see you smile. Every moment spent with you feels like a page from a fairy tale—a story where love conquers all, where you are my beginning, my middle, and my happy ending. 
      <br>
      You’re the melody to my silence, the light to my shadow, the reason behind every ounce of happiness I feel. Watching you, capturing you, loving you—it’s all my way of holding onto the beauty you bring into my life, reminding myself that I’m the luckiest person in the world to have you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re not just important to me—you’re the very reason I breathe, my sanctuary in a chaotic world. The way you light up my days with just your presence is nothing short of a miracle. I cherish every little thing about you—the way you laugh, the way your eyes sparkle when you’re excited, the way you trust me with your thoughts and dreams. You make me want to be better, to dream bigger, to love harder. 
      <br>
      You are my strength when I falter, my peace when the world feels overwhelming. You’ve taught me what it truly means to love and to be loved, and for that, I will forever be grateful. You are my heart, my soul, my everything.
    </p>

      <b>A Shayari for you:</b><br>
      Tere bina zindagi adhoori si lagti hai,<br>
      Har khushi teri muskaan se sajti hai.<br>
      Tujhse milkar samajh aaya mohabbat ka maqsad,<br>
      Tere saath hi har saans chalti hai.<br>
      <br>
      Duniya ke mele mein bas tu hi apna lagta hai,<br>
      Tera naam dil pe likha, aur har sapna tu lagta hai.<br>
      Tu hai toh sab kuch hai, warna kuch nahi,<br>
      Tujhse mohabbat meri pehchaan ban gayi hai.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p><b>A Thank note for you Lovviee</b><br>Thank you my love. Thank you for being in my life, for loving me and
      understanding me. Thank you for being my
      best buddy, my well wisher and my support. Thank you for being my Strength , my Therapy , my healer , my
      everything . Thank you for pushing me because if you had not been there for me, I
      would have been lost in this big wide world.Thank you for the
      confidence you have shown in me. I will
      stay by your side till end of time. I Love You.</p>

      <p>
        You know what lovviee , Jab hum ladte-jhagadte hain na, tabhi toh hamara bond aur bhi zyada
         strong ho jaata hai. Chhoti-moti nok-jhok, tiff ya gussa — yeh sab dikhata hai ki hum ek-dusre
          ko kitna importance dete hain. Agar farak na padta, toh na ladayi hoti, na manaana hota. 
          Har ek nok-jhok ke baad jo sulah hoti hai, usmein thoda aur pyaar jud jaata hai. 
          Qki aisa h ki reh nii pata na ek dusre k bina ...
          Shayad isi liye kehte hain — jinke beech zyada ladayi hoti hai, unke beech rishte aur gehre hote hain.

        Kanyakumari aur Varkala ka safar sirf ek vacation nahi tha, ek yaadon ka bhandaar tha.
         Samundar ke kinare baithi woh shaanti, shaam ke waqt sunset ka nazara —
          lagta tha jaise time thoda ruk gaya ho. Kanyakumari mein teen samudron ka milna aur uss
           mahaan Vivekananda Rock par khade hoke apne andar ki shanti ko mehsoos karna — woh feeling
            lafzon mein nahi aati. Varkala ke cliffs, uss beach ka vibe, aur wo behtareen noodles wali date — 
            sab kuch bas dil mein bas gaya. Iss taraf dil 
            silently keh raha tha: “Yaar, yeh moment kabhi khatam na ho.” Har smile,laugh, har candid photo, 
            aur woh raste mein sundar views,gana gate hue drive krna tumhare saath was d bestt one ,
         Ye trip sirf jagah dekhne ka
             nahi tha, ek doosre ko aur khud ko mehsoos karne k liye tha , jo hm aage or v jyada krte rhenge .

    <p>We both know we have a very special relationship -Without ever needing to say so how in love we are.

      But now I want to say you are very precious to me. I love to be close to you. You are more beautiful than
      sunshine,
      more precious than gold. You are sweeter than candy and more lovely than the moon. You are exquisite and
      delightful,
      special and unique. And what's most astounding of all, you want to be with me.
